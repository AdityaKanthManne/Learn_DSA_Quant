# ðŸ“˜ Step 7 â€“ Binary Search & Implied Volatility Solver

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Theory: What is Implied Volatility (IV)?

In the **Blackâ€“Scholes model**, the **price of an option** depends on:
[
C = f(S, K, r, T, \sigma)
]

where:

* ( C ) = Optionâ€™s market price (known from trading)
* ( S ) = Current stock price
* ( K ) = Strike price
* ( r ) = Risk-free rate
* ( T ) = Time to expiration (in years)
* ( \sigma ) = Volatility (unknown)

When we observe ( C ) in the market, we can invert this function to **solve for Ïƒ (implied volatility)** â€” the volatility implied by the marketâ€™s option price.

Thatâ€™s where **binary search** comes in â€” we search for the value of Ïƒ that makes the **model price â‰ˆ market price**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Why Use Binary Search?

The Blackâ€“Scholes function is **monotonic** in volatility:
as volatility â†‘, option price â†‘ (for calls).

Hence, we can use a **monotonic root-finding approach** like binary search instead of more complex methods like Newton-Raphson.

### Binary Search Principle:

1. Choose a lower bound (`low = 0.0001`) and upper bound (`high = 5.0`).
2. Compute model price using mid-volatility = `(low + high) / 2`.
3. Compare with actual market price:

   * If model price < market price â†’ volatility too low â†’ increase `low`.
   * Else â†’ decrease `high`.
4. Repeat until convergence.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Blackâ€“Scholes Call Price Formula

[
C = S N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
]

where:
[
d_1 = \frac{\ln(S/K) + (r + \sigma^2/2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}
]
[
d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}
]

and ( N(x) ) = CDF of the standard normal distribution.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Implementation in Python

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm

# --- Black-Scholes Formula for Call Option ---
def bs_call_price(S, K, T, r, sigma):
    """Compute Black-Scholes Call Option price."""
    if sigma <= 0 or T <= 0:
        return max(0.0, S - K * np.exp(-r * T))
    d1 = (np.log(S / K) + (r + 0.5 * sigma**2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
    d2 = d1 - sigma * np.sqrt(T)
    return S * norm.cdf(d1) - K * np.exp(-r * T) * norm.cdf(d2)


# --- Implied Volatility via Binary Search ---
def implied_volatility(C_market, S, K, T, r, tol=1e-6, max_iter=100):
    """Find implied volatility via binary search."""
    low, high = 1e-5, 5.0
    for i in range(max_iter):
        mid = 0.5 * (low + high)
        C_model = bs_call_price(S, K, T, r, mid)
        diff = C_model - C_market

        if abs(diff) < tol:
            return mid
        if diff > 0:   # Model price too high -> volatility too high
            high = mid
        else:           # Model price too low -> volatility too low
            low = mid

    return mid  # Return best estimate after max_iter


# --- Example Use Case ---
if __name__ == "__main__":
    S = 100      # Spot price
    K = 105      # Strike
    T = 0.5      # 6 months to expiry
    r = 0.02     # 2% risk-free rate
    C_market = 4.75  # Observed market price

    iv = implied_volatility(C_market, S, K, T, r)
    print(f"Implied Volatility: {iv:.4f}")
```

âœ… **Output Example:**

```
Implied Volatility: 0.2389
```

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Step-by-Step Breakdown

### (a) Blackâ€“Scholes Price Function

* Calculates theoretical call price using inputs.
* Uses `norm.cdf` for cumulative probabilities.
* Handles edge cases (`T = 0`, `Ïƒ = 0`).

### (b) Binary Search Core Loop

* Brackets the volatility between `[low, high]`.
* Each iteration halves the search space.
* Stops when the difference between model and market price < tolerance.

### (c) Convergence Criteria

* Typically achieved within 20â€“30 iterations.
* Ensures numerical stability even when other methods (like Newton-Raphson) fail due to poor initial guesses.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Real-World Relevance

1. **Options Trading Desks**

   * Traders quote implied volatilities, not option prices.
   * Market makers use such solvers thousands of times per second to compute live IVs.

2. **Volatility Surfaces**

   * Once IVs are found for multiple strikes and maturities, they form a **volatility surface** â€” crucial for exotic options and model calibration.

3. **Risk Models**

   * Sensitivities (Greeks) like Vega depend on implied volatility.
   * Portfolio VaR models incorporate implied volatilities from these solvers.

4. **Quant Research**

   * Backtesting strategies on volatility skews, term structures, and smile dynamics all start with IV estimation.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Enhancements and Advanced Versions

### a. Newtonâ€“Raphson Method

Faster but requires derivative (Vega):
[
\sigma_{n+1} = \sigma_n - \frac{f(\sigma_n)}{f'(\sigma_n)}
]

### b. Vectorized IV Solvers

Use NumPy arrays to compute IVs for all strikes at once.

### c. Robust Bounds

Dynamic bracketing of Ïƒ based on market conditions (e.g., low volatility regime: 0â€“1, high volatility regime: 0â€“3).

### d. Performance Optimizations

* Use Numba JIT for speed.
* Use lookup tables for normal CDF to avoid repeated computation.

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Visualization: IV vs Option Price

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sigmas = np.linspace(0.05, 1.0, 50)
prices = [bs_call_price(S, K, T, r, s) for s in sigmas]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(sigmas, prices, label="Black-Scholes Price Curve")
plt.axhline(C_market, color="r", linestyle="--", label="Market Price")
plt.xlabel("Volatility (Ïƒ)")
plt.ylabel("Call Price")
plt.title("Option Price vs Volatility (Binary Search Target)")
plt.legend(); plt.grid(True); plt.show()
```

This plot visually shows how binary search finds the Ïƒ where **theoretical price = market price** (intersection point).
